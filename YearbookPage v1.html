			<p>From the outside, being a hockey player looks tough.
			Being slammed into walls, pushed onto the ice, and
			whacked by a stick can't possibly be enjoyable... but
			Adam Weiner ('17) would beg to differ.</p>

			<p>In fact, hockey is not just enjoyable. It's inspiring.
			One of the most important games for the hockey
			team was the game against Middleton. It was senior
			night, and although they suffered a loss, it was still a
			pivotal moment for the team. "Our team finally got
			to see how we could keep up with, and even have a
			chance of beating the third ranked team in the state,"
			explained Adam Weiner ('17). "Our determination to
			win during the game was absolutely remarkable."</p>

			<p>Even though the guys worked hard on the rink,
			they still make sure to have fun together as a team
			outside of games and practice. "After the Middleton
			game and the banquet that night, some of us decided
			to go to Oscars and get ice cream," remembered
			Weiner. "Then, we went and had a dance party in
			the parking lot when it was only fifteen degrees
			out... for no reason in particular. It really was a fun
			experience to have with a team as great as mine."</p>

			<p>The hockey team greatly focuses on the team
			aspect of the sport. They have had a very successful
			season, largely in part to this. “Not a lot of players at
			higher levels play for themselves, but rather for the
			respect of their coaches and their teammates, which
			means you have a bunch of guys who are working
			hard and playing for the love of the game,” stated
			Weiner. So maybe he’s getting slammed into the
			wall, pushed onto the ice, and hit with sticks... but
			he wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
